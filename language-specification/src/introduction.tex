\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
This document provides a complete specification for the project, detailing the use of a domain-specific language (DSL) based on the Extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF) grammar. The DSL is designed to facilitate the management and development of software projects, regardless of the specific methodology used, such as Scrum, Kanban or other agile frameworks. Defines constructs to represent key elements necessary for effective project management, including projects, teams, tasks, lists, functions, loops, conditionals, and other essential components. By providing a structured and adaptable language, this DSL aims to improve clarity, reduce complexity and improve the overall efficiency of project management processes.
