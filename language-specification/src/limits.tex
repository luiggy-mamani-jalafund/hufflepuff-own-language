\begin{enumerate}
	\item [Limited Data Types] The grammar only supports a few basic data types like strings, booleans, and tasks. It lacks more complex data structures like dictionaries or sets.
	\item [No Nested Structures] The grammar allows lists within lists, but it doesn't allow for nesting other complex structures like tasks within tasks or members within members.
	\item [Limited Operators] The grammar only supports basic comparison operators and logical operators. It doesn't include arithmetic operators or more advanced functions for manipulating data.
	\item [Restricted String Handling] While the grammar allows for different string types with spaces and paragraphs, it lacks functionalities for string manipulation like concatenation or substring extraction.
	\item [No User Input] The grammar doesn't have any constructs for taking input from the user.
	\item [Limited Functionality] It is not suitable for general-purpose programming tasks.
