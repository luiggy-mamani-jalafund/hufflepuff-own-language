\section{Compiled or Interpreter}
\label{sec:compiled-or-interpreter}
Our EBNF could be said to be based on or have influences from JavaScript/TypeScript or Python, given the use of common structures such as conditionals and loops, as well as the way functions and templates are defined. \\

Due to the similarity it has with those languages, the team considered it viable to create an interpreter.
